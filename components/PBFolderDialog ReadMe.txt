Component Version: 1.30.00.00

PBFolderDialog is SHBrowseForFolder dialog with capability of creating new folders when browsing for a folder.
It can show path above the window.
The 'New folder'-button caption and a 'Label'-caption (shown above the path) are automatic localized (national language) detected every time the application runs.

The component is based on Todd Fast's TBrowseFolder component.
Thanks to Gaetano Giunta for great bug-fixing in version 1.20.00.00.

Context-sensitive help is included.

Legal stuff:
------------
PBFolderDialog is Freeware. Use it any way, you like. There is no timelimit or 'nag-screens'. Applications developed using this component are yours alone, Baksoft-Denmark have no rights to it.

PBFolderDialog is provided 'as-is' and Baksoft-Denmark is under no circumstances responsible for any damage, what soever, that it might cause to anyone or anything.

Installation:
-------------
1. Unzip all files to a folder of your choice.
2. Start Delphi (if you haven't done so).
3. Choose menu 'Component', 'Install Component...', browse to the folder that contains the unzipped files, choose 'PBFolderDialog.pas' and open the file. Press 'Ok'. Press 'Yes' to confirm rebuild. PBFolderDialog is now Registered. Close the window (save the changes).

Now you have a new Palette-page named 'PB' with the new component.

Install context-sensitive help:
-------------------------------
1. Move or copy 'PBFolderDialog.hlp' and 'PBFolderDialog.cnt' to ..\Delphi 3\Help folder.
2. Doubleclick 'Delphi3.cnt' and 'Microsoft Help Workshop' starts. Click 'Index Files', 'add'. Type 'PBFolderDialog' as Help title and 'PBFolderDialog.hlp' as Help filename. Click 'Ok'.
3. Include 'PBFolderDialog' on the main page (Insert above).
4. Exit 'Microsoft Help Workshop' and save the changes.

Now you have full context-sensitive help for the PBFolderDialog component.
--------------------------------
I have included a small demo: Project1.exe to show the basics. Load and run.
