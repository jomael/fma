This document describes HOTWO create/update new template file when a new
FMA release is out. Do this on regular basis and commit new template to CVS
in order to help Fma Translators and keep them with up-to-date inforation.

0. If you are using CVS checkout module, make sure files are in Edit state:
   * default.po
   * ignore.po
   * dxgettext.ini
   * languages.po  (optional)
   because they will be overwritted by dxGetText in next step, and later you
   should commit changed files into CVS branch. File "default.po" fill be 
   updated automatically by dxGetText application, while the file "ignore.po"
   should be edited manually by you in step 2 (see the hint there)!

1. Create new default.po file:

   New template is created by windows explorer (if we have installed dxGetText):
   click with right mouse button over trunk folder (in Explorer's tree view!) and 
   select from local menu option "Extract translations to template". Check all 
   checkboxes in dialog and click OK. This will produce file ...\fma\default.po
   which is the new template file (click Yes to override file when/if promted).

2. VERY IMPORTANT STEP, DO NOT PASS IT BY, since it has to be done by hand and 
   takes some time to complete, but it is strongly recommended task:

   When new default.po file is created open it with UniRed Text Editor (or some 
   other utf8 enabled editor), open also ignore.po file. For example, this is 
   fragment from default.po file:

   QUOTE (fragmet from default.po) 
   -------------------------------
   #. frmEditContact..PageControl1..TabSheet2..GroupBox1..btnPicDel..Caption
   #: uEditContact.dfm:454
   #. frmEditContact..PageControl1..TabSheet2..GroupBox2..btnSndDel..Caption
   #: uEditContact.dfm:542
   #. frmOptions..PageControl1..TabSheet10..grOutlookCategories..btDelCat..Caption
   #: uOptions.dfm:633
   #. frmOptions..pmOutlookCats..CatRemove1..Caption
   #: uOptions.dfm:2478
   msgid "Remove"
   msgstr ""

   #. frmEditContact..PageControl1..TabSheet2..GroupBox2..Caption
   #: uEditContact.dfm:464
   #. do not localize
   #: uExploreView.pas:196
   msgid "This text must be ignored AND NOT TRANSLATED!"
   msgstr ""

   #. frmEditContact..PageControl1..TabSheet2..GroupBox2..Label17..Caption
   #: uEditContact.dfm:485
   msgid "Sound information:"
   msgstr ""
   -------------------------------

   Simply select second paragraph (comments(#), msgid and msgstr rows) which must 
   not be translated, cut and paste at end of ignore.po file.

   Our goal is to move all Properties values which should not be translated, into
   ignore.po file. And since you're the developer you will know which ones should
   be moved and which ones not. Also some special text as Registry keys etc should
   be ignored too, etc. I think you got the point.

   Wraning! Comment "#. do not localize" is imported from source code in string 
   extraction time. This is text of first after // comment after string in source 
   code. Maybe this is bug (or feature?) in dxgettext string extractor, but this  
   may generate wrong "#. do not localize" comment in .po file.

   HINT: You should use CVS Diff on file "default.po" to see only changes, then it
   is really easy to expect only these changes and move appropriate parts into
   file "ignore.po" :) I am using Araxis Merge tool for that part...

   One more time - You have to look at file "default.po" and check out EVERY line:

   msgid "Xxxx"

   and see if it should be moved to file "ignore.po" or not. It is up to you to do
   this part right! Do it carefuly!

3. Name the newly generated template:

   I think that latest.po and updated.po is not good names for this files. May 
   be default-20050101.po (or .pot) is better. Update files are not necessary because 
   new POT file is updated by PoEdit with old translation and translator must translate 
   only new texts.

4. Publish template to SVN and FMA Files page.

   Copy this file to ...\fma\locale\en\LC_MESSAGES and upload it to SVN. Also if you
   are Release Technician you could ZIP the LC_MESSAGES folder and publish it to FMA
   Files section at sf.net web site (optional but recommended).
   
That's all! :)
