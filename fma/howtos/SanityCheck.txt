FMA SANITY CHECKLIST

To be performed before releasing new FMA build. All of the listed checks 
should be applied. 

If any of then fails, the releasing should be canceled and all bugs fixed. 
Then sanity check should be performed from the very begining.

If all checks succeeded, then release could be compiled to a setup file.
