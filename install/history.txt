FMA 2.1 Beta 4

Release Notes:

Hi all! Consider this as BETA software. Please report any
BUGS to our web page at SourceForge.net. We have decided
to release one more BETA version before going to final
FMA 2.2 build, so here is the latest FMA 2.1 Beta 4.

The current build includes many bugfixes and improvements.
Some new features were implemented too, as separating FMA's
and Phone's Text Messages folders. Now moving SMS messages
between Phone and FMA is more intuitional and easy than
before.

This BETA version does not include latest support for Sony
Ericsson phones W900, M600 and similar. Some new brands as
K610 are partially supported (no Groups, no Bookmarks), and
we have plans to add full support for them in final FMA 2.2
if possible.

Always do a backup of profile databases before using this 
new FMA Beta 4.

Important Notices:

o User Folders and Delivery Rules:

All Custom Text Messages folders (if any) were moved under 
new Explorer's node named FMA Text Folders. On first FMA
start you will be prompted to relocate all of these folders.
Just create an appripriate new folder for every old one.

And all Delivery Rules attached to the old folders will be 
automatically relocated to the corresponding new folders.
You don't have to care about this.

o FMA Portable Mode settings:

If you have chosen "Don't ask me again for this device"
option in Portable Mode dialog and want to revert this
setting, then hold down CTRL key to ignore any Portable 
Mode settings and show FMA Startup mode selection dialog 
again.

o Web Update from version 2.1.3.33:

This applies only to FMA 2.1.3.33. If you are using or
installing a different version, skip this notes.

How to update from 2.1.3.33 version which hang-ups?

- Exit FMA and go to following directory:
C:\Documents and Settings\<your-user-name>\Application Data

- Rename FMA folder to FMA_old

- Start 2.1.3.33 version and update it to 33a patch

- Exit FMA and go back to directory:
C:\Documents and Settings\<your-user-name>\Application Data

- Delete FMA folder (remember, your data is in FMA_old one)

- Rename FMA_old folder back to FMA

Now you can use new patched FMA with your data preserved.
